# db-walker
An ORM and Query Builder for MySQL and CockroachDB (similar to [Cassandra walker](https://github.com/jozn/cassandra-walker)). 

This has a lot of features: memory cashing, events, default funcs based on tables indexes, Protocol Buffer output,â€¦ .

This tool is production ready in our projects but is not yet open-source ready, it still uses internal API and need's open source quality documentations.
